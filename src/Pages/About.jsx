                <p>
                    Welcome to <strong>FLICKPICK</strong>, where the magic of movies comes to life! 
                    Established in 1990, our theatre has been a beloved destination for film lovers, families, 
                    and friends in KALLAKURICHI. We began as a small, independent cinema with a mission 
                    to provide a unique and unforgettable movie-going experience. Over the years, we’ve grown 
                    and evolved, but our passion for great films and exceptional customer service remains the same.
